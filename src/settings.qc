// This file contains some settings which you might want to customize.  If
// you change anything in here you'll have to recompile the ../progs.dat
// or ../qwprogs.dat file in order for the settings to take effect.
//
// Most people will want to edit settings.qc in either the poq directory
// (for plain old Quake) or the qw directory (for Quakeworld).  People
// who will be working on the source more extensively should see the the
// "source editing" section of the Notes file in the source distribution.
//
// To recompile ../progs.dat or ../qwprogs.dat, you'll need a Quake-C
// compiler.  The complete list of compilers is at,
//
//     ftp://ftp.runequake.com/quake/quakec/compilers/
//
// After you unzip the compiler, run it in either the poq or qw folder.
//
// ### IMPORTANT: As of Rune Quake version 0.5, you are limited to using
//                the qccx 1.0 or frikqcc 2.5 compiler.              ###
